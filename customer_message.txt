Dear SERGIO ARREOLA,

We're making great strides on your project with Del Mar Builders. Recently, we've completed the flooring installation and are progressing with final touches. Challenges due to material delays have been adeptly navigated, ensuring work continues smoothly. We're currently clearing warranty issues, aiming for your complete satisfaction before final sign-off. Expect further updates as we move closer to completion. Your patience and trust in us are greatly appreciated.

Warm regards,
Del Mar Builders Team
