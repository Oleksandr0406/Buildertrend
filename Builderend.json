The insured complains of rotten plywood on the dormer faces and says he will not sign off until this work is covered and completed with new siding. We have tried to explain the wood deterioration and rot is almost never covered under any insurance policy due to the fact that this is age/wear and tear related damage, not caused by the storm that the claim was filed for. We also provided the insured with an estimate for repair and replacement of these areas as an out-of-pocket expense, although he refused this as well.\nSince June 7th we have had numerous conversations with the insured, and we have also posted notes to the file explaining the situation on June 12, 19, and 28. A call was also made to the adjuster on two different occasions as well as a phone call to Sedgwick Rep Brianne Aucoin with no response. \nThe insured has now been nonresponsive for about two weeks.\n\nWe are hoping for help in resolving this matter so we can finalize the claim ASAP and receive final payment ($7,882.13) for the work completed. Unfortunately, if we do not hear back from the insured by the end of the week, we will be forced send an intent to lien to the insured, as this would put us at about 3 weeks of zero contact.\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to estimator Brendan Burns at 219-257-2477 --- Brendanb@getdelmar.com, or project manager Jason Brendle at 773-307-2737 --- jasonb@getdelmar.com. \n\nThank you!\n\nAngela P.

He has seen something like this a few times in his career and it has always been lightning related. So were thinking lightening struck, causing a massive surge in the electrical system ultimately leading to the sump pump (causing flood), HVAC, electrical outlets, and light fixtures to no longer function properly. Based on the overall symptoms/various issues caused to the home post storm, I believe this claim to be categorized as a \"water loss\" is an understatement. \n \n If it is of any help, I can setup a three-way call with my electrician who might be able to articulate the issue better verbally, rather than written on a document. Please let me know if this is something we can put together. \n \n I hope this was of any help..\n \n Thank you! \n \n Brendan Burns\n Del Mar Builders \n Estimator \n 219-257-2477 Email sent to mark.deleon@usaa.com; christi.mitchell@contractorconnection.com; eddiej@getdelmar.com; angelab@getdelmar.com",

Mitigation has not started yet and are delayed due to asbestos testing. \nThe city is also supposed to come out and dig a 6x6 by 4ft deep area in the basement to repair the line that is causing the water damage. Due to this, I am unable to provide an accurate and complete scope of work. I am unsure what the extent of the repairs will be once the city comes in to complete their scope. Please advise if you would like for me to upload a preliminary estimate, or wait until the city has completed the dig and mitigation has completed so a complete scope can be provided. \n\nThank you!\n\n\nBrendan Burns\nDel Mar Builders \nEstimator \n219-257-2477\n\nEmail sent to eddiej@getdelmar.com; angelab@getdelmar.com",

When he arrived, the insured was able to let him in but not able to speak as she was tied up in meetings. He returned again yesterday to apply a 4th top coat to the floor. Per our hardwood floor specialist, there is not much more he can do to get the floor looking any better than it does after the 4th coat. We feel that the expectation of the insured is the floor are to look perfect when we are finished, although hand finished hardwood floors rarely have zero impurities due to the imperfect nature of wood. Jason, our hardwood floor specialist is the best we have and we have had no issues with any of his work in the past. If the floor is still seen as unacceptable, we would like to request a field representative meet us at the property to review the work in hopes of coming to a resolution as soon as possible.\n\nAs for the cabinets, we have communicated with the insured that we will repair the cabinet toe kick when the hardwood floor work is approved. Our floor specialist had to tape of the toe kick and side panels to avoid getting stain or varnish on the cabinets, and unfortunately the tape took a small section of paint of the toe kick. We have agreed to fix this once we are completed with the floor, and the insured passes the floor. \n\nWhen the floor is approved we have our drywall/painter on call to go back and finish paint of trims, repair toe kick, and we can also take a look at the door to see if anything else can be done to clean rather than replace. Although as previously stated, we cannot send another crew to the property to complete this until the floor is signed off on. \n\nPM Jason Brendle will be reaching out to the insured tomorrow to discuss the floor and see how they feel about the work that has been completed to the floor.\n\nPlease feel free to reach out directly to myself, or PM Jason Brendle at 773-307-2737, as we would be more than happy to answer any additional questions you might have. \n\nThank you.\n\nBrendan Burns\nDel Mar Builders \nEstimator \n219-257-2477\n\nEmail sent to Joanna.Milton@ContractorConnection.com; monique.ford@usaa.com; angelab@getdelmar.com; jasonb@getdelmar.com; mikeh@getdelmar.com",

                "note": "Good evening, \n \n The insured is aware that the 2 additional coats of paint are not approved by the insurance policy, this is OOP change order the insured added before job start. The insured is expecting for a paint job to including extensive prep work to old and worn paneling and expects the paneling to look new when we are done. We tried to manage expectation regarding the paneling painting, an tat there is no way to prep and repair paneling that has these kinds of impurities and made to look new side from replacing the paneling. \n \n When talks between the insured and the PM Jason Brendl were underway regarding scheduling the kitchen floor refinishing, the insured mentioned a range of dates that shew was already going to be out of town and asked if we could schedule the floor refinish during this time. We did not request that she need to be out of the house during these repairs. the flooring repairs do not inhibit the customers from entering their home our allowing them access to the second floor of the home where the office and bedrooms, as well as a bathroom are located. The floors started Tuesday the 2nd, during the time the insured was out of town, and the floors were completed Friday late morning, and the insured came back into town Friday evening. The only request that was made was that the insured stay off the floors Friday night an wait until Saturday to walk into the kitchen. Sunday afternoon, the insured texted Jason relaying that she was not satisfied with the floor refinish work, and that she would like for someone to come by and have a look. Jason let the insured know that he would be stopping by Monday afternoon to check on the crew and take a look at the floors. When Jason arrived, the crew was working and the insured entered the home, and said that she cannot talk and needed to make a phone call, and would not be available to have a conversation with Jason until 430PM. Understandably, Jason was not in a position to wait 3 hours for the insured to be available, although the crew had already been working on touching up the areas that the insured did not like. \n \n On Tuesday the 9th, The insured was using the basement for her office space working, and our foreman asked when she would be finished with work so the drywall crew can get down there and start on drywall repairs. The insured asked how long the crew would need, because it will be difficult to move her space that night because \"every other room in the house is not usable\". this seemed unreasonable because there are three bedrooms, a living room, and an office in the basement that is usable, where no work is being completed. the insured then asked if they can start around 2. Our foreman asked if they could start down there at around 330PM instead, and that the crew would need a few hours to finish drywall and tape, so that it could dry overnight and be ready for additional coats of mud (if needed) or ready to sand by Wednesday morning. The insured responded saying \"okay, thanks then you can start drywall at 5PM tonight.\" \n \n If needed, we have documented text correspondence between our foreman Tammy and the insured, as well as separate texts with our PM Jason regarding this situation that we can provide. We are doing our best the work with the insured, we understand that any construction taking place in a residence can be inconvenient and stressful.. however our crews need to be able to access these areas, and be allowed to complete work tasks without constant micromanagement and complaints. Any workmanships issues will be addressed, although some of the complaints are about work that has not been completed or considered the \"finished product.\" \n \n At this time, Jason has elected to remove the current crew and replace with new faces to hopefully salvage the situation.\n \n Brendan Burns\n Del Mar Builders \n Estimator \n 219-257-2477&lt;",

The adjuster met out there with me and made changes to the estimate and sent me the ESX file and a report of his findings/changes. I uploaded is ESX and sent his estimate in. Is the adjusters reinspection estimate not what we should be working off of? Based on the field adjuster and I's conversation on site, he was there to verify damages and made adjustments to the estimate as needed.. \n So when I get review notes back from a field adjusters estimate, those review notes need to be made, and it doesn't matter what the field adjuster wrote? Because again, the last estimate I uploaded was a copy paste of your adjusters estimate which is why I ignored MICA reports.\n \n Can you please give me a call to clarify this process for better success in the future?
